Description: This scenario involves the illegal exfiltration of copyrighted animal images from the FTP server of Animal Photo. On June 6, 2020, between 10 AM and 11:30 AM, an unauthorized individual accessed the company’s network and exfiltrated twelve protected images. The investigation traced the source of the exfiltration to a device named Emily-Stan-Laptop within the company's internal network. The destination IP address of the stolen data was 203.0.113.5, which was registered under the name Rose Judy. Further analysis revealed that the actual user associated with this IP address was Will Judy, Rose Judy's son.
