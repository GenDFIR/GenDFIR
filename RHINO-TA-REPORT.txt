Based on the provided context and analysis of digital artefacts, I can identify evidence related to a rhino and provide mitigation solutions.
**Evidence Identification:**
* The following images feature a rhino: + Event 1 (Image a) + Event 2 (Image b) + Event 3 (Image c) + Event 8 (Image k)
All these images were transferred from Emily-Stan-Laptop with IP address 192.168.1.10 to an FTP server at IP address 192.0.2.1, then to the Will Device
with IP address 203.0.113.5 using File Transfer timestamps on June 6, 2020.
**Timeline Analysis:**
Based on the timestamp provided in each event, a rough timeline of events can be constructed:
| Event # | Time Stamp | Action |
| — | — | — |
| 1 | 10:08:15 | Image (a) transferred |
| 2 | 10:22:47 | Image (b) transferred |
| 3 | 10:34:56 | Image (c) transferred |
| 4 | 10:45:30 | Image of a cheetah (f) transferred |
| 5 | 10:56:04 | A green alligator image transferred |
| 6 | 11:08:23 | Two crocodiles transferred |
| 7 | 11:20:45 | Elephant and baby elephant transferred |
| 8 | 11:30:00 | Image (k) of a rhino transferred |
Based on the timestamp for both Images a and k from Emily-Stan-Laptop, this suggests continuous or connected activity between these instances, involving
the targeted exfiltration.
**Correlation of Events:**
From the timeline constructed above, it is clear that all events listed occurred within minutes of each other. This indicates a high volume of rapid data transfer
activities taking place from the same system (Emily-Stan-Laptop) and to the same destination device for images featuring animals in various scenarios.
This might indicate an orchestrated malicious activity possibly exploiting vulnerabilities or misusing privileges related to FTP handling on Emily -Stan-laptop.
**Mitigation Solutions:**
1. **Restrict FTP server access**: Only provide necessary rights on the source system to ensure that there are no unauthorized processes capable of
transferring data without notice.
2. **Increase auditing capabilities**: Implement monitoring mechanisms or logging systems capable of recording every transfer related to this context to
enhance visibility and aid in quick incident response if similar activities recur.
3. Investigate Emily-Stan-Laptop: Run thorough analysis to check for evidence of unauthorized access, malware, or software misuse on the source system
that could have caused these rapid file transfers.
These recommendations serve as the first steps towards investigating and addressing the potential security concerns observed during this incident response
process.
