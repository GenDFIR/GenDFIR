**Incident Analysis**

I have analyzed the given event IDs to identify anomalous events, conducted a timeline analysis, correlated between them, reconstructed the events timeline, and provided precise mitigation solutions.

10. **2016/09/15 02:31:55**: Event ID 4723 - Attempt to change account password (Source: Windows Security)
11. **2016/09/15 02:32:07**: Event ID 5038 - Integrity of system file failed [duplicated] (Source: System)
12. **2016/09/15 02:34:30**: Event ID 4771 - Pre-authentication failed [duplicated] (Source: Security)
13. **2016/09/15 02:36:15**: Event ID 4776 - Logon failure due to incorrect credentials [duplicated] (Source: Windows Security)
14. **2016/09/15 02:36:30**: Event ID 5031 - Firewall service encountered an error [duplicated] (Source: Security)
15. **2016/09/15 02:37:45**: Event ID 4625 - Logon attempt failed [duplicated] (Source: Windows Security)

**Anomalous Events and Trends**

1. Multiple attempts to change account password (Event IDs 4723) between 2:17 AM and 2:31 AM.
2. Repeated pre-authentication failures (Event ID 4771) between 2:22 AM and 2:34 AM.
3. Logon attempt failures (Event IDs 4625, 4627) multiple times between 2:17 AM and 2:37 PM.
4. Firewall service encountered errors (Event ID 5031) at different intervals between 2:24 AM and 2:36 PM.

**Root Cause Analysis**

These events suggest a possible malicious action or an automated script that was attempted to gain unauthorized access. The repeated failures may indicate a faulty password reset attempt or other security measures that could not be bypassed.

**Mitigation Solutions**

1. **Enhance Security Measures**: Immediate updates and patches should be applied to counter vulnerabilities.
2. **Alert System Deployment**: Activate systems capable of detecting such attempts in real-time to prevent further occurrences.
3. **Audit Logging Review**: Review all logging mechanisms to determine if more detailed records are needed.
4. **Training Session**: Update security training to emphasize common attack vectors and prevention strategies.

**Recommendations**

1. The security team needs to review the system's configuration for any vulnerabilities that could have been exploited.
2. Investigate these events further with a focus on identifying potential weaknesses the attacker might have used.
3. Conduct in-depth audits of systems, configurations, and account management policies to prevent similar incidents from recurring.

While I've reconstructed the timeline and identified possible vulnerabilities, actual mitigation efforts should be handled by security teams who can take into consideration all necessary factors within your organization.
